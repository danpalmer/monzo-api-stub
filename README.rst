      Stub Monzo API

    Options:
      --host TEXT             Address to bind to.
      --port INTEGER          Port for the HTTP server.
      --num-accounts INTEGER  Number of accounts to give the user
      --currency TEXT         Currency to use, pass "random" to use random

Note: This is not guaranteed to be API compatible. It is a best-effort attempt
to provide a useful tool for developers building for the Monzo API.


Features
--------

- OAuth flow with immediate redirect, no need to enter an email address.
- Test with pre-defined or random currencies.
- Test as a user with multiple accounts.


Completeness
------------

Since this is a stub API, most "business logic" on the server side isn't
implemented, and likely won't be.

This should however be considered a work in progress, and any PRs that bring
responses/endpoints closer to those of the real API, or any that add entirely
missing endpoints, are very welcome.

Things that are missing:

- OAuth exchange is fake - I'd like to add this in a basic way to make it easier
  to test the OAuth flow.

- No auth headers required - Would be good to have a basic (optional?) auth
  check.

- Verbose request logging - to help see what your client application is sending.

- Loading custom data - to allow testing of specific cases that your app
  wants to handle.
